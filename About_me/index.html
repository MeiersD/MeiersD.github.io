                Hi, my name is Meiers Dixon. I am a PhD student at Virginia Tech studying biochemistry. I also like thru-hiking. I have hiked 
                <a href="https://www.teararoa.org.nz/" target="website">Te Araroa</a> in the 2024-25 season and the <a href="https://hike-mst.org/" target="website">Pennsylvania Mid State Trail</a> 
                in the 2025 season. I'm thinking about hiking either HexaTrek or the Arizona Trail next. Often, I post youtube videos vlogging my adventures. 
                Other hobbies of mine include coding, configuring neovim, and Magic: the Gathering.

                I hope you enjoyed the home page of my website. I am a big fan of PyMol,
                so I thought I'd try my hand at making a similar version of the software in javascript. I did not think I would end up liking javascript
                so much, but I'm finding it to be quite an enjoyable language. This entire website is hosted in a public repository on my Github, so please feel 
                free to poke around there if you'd like. Another polished piece of software I developed with my cofounders is 
                <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eigofy/foefaklgdkdbnpfcfoiplcejnefgemnf" target="Eigofy on the chrome webstore">Eigofy</a>, 
                which helps Japanese people learn English. Please consider checking that out if you are interested.

                I have also added WebXR functionality to the site. If you have a Meta Quest, Apple Vision, or any other form of XR headset, you can see the protein in
                AR. Navigate to the browser, then type in the url for this website. Then, the "AR not supported" button can be pushed, and you will be teleported into the
                center of the protein. You can reopen the browser while AR is activated to change the color and rotation. I added a YouTube video demonstrating this 
                functionality in case you don't own a XR headset.
