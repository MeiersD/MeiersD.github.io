                Hi, my name is Meiers Dixon. I am a Senior neuroscience major at Bucknell University. I also have minors in
                chemistry and computer science. Since my freshman year, I have been working in <a href="https://sites.google.com/bucknell.edu/rstockla/" 
                target="Lab Website">Dr. Robert Stockland's organic chemistry lab</a> which has helped me find a 
                passion for molecules and the structure of the world around us. Last year, I started to take more computer science courses after being 
                inspired by the <a href="https://www.pymol.org/" target="pymol website">PyMol</a> software we used in Biochemistry class. One of the reasons I like
                organic chemistry is because it turns something quantitative into a form of art. PyMol is very similar, it grants fantastic customization, control, 
                and visualization of atoms in Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. This past summer, I worked in <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/~scb-group-web/blog/" 
                target="Lab Website">Dr. Scott Calabrese Barton's data science lab</a> at Michigan State University. There, I created molecular dynamics simulations; 
                using a software called <a href="https://www.gromacs.org/" target="pymol website">GROMACS</a> on the command line to create movies of proteins in real time.
                All of these experiences have led me to form a deep appreciation for the beauty of protein structures.

                I hope you enjoyed the home page of my website. I am a big fan of PyMol,
                so I thought I'd try my hand at making a similar version of the software in javascript. I did not think I would end up liking javascript
                so much, but I'm finding it to be quite an enjoyable language. This entire website is hosted in a public repository on my Github, so please feel 
                free to poke around there if you'd like. My roommates and I recently published a chrome extension called 
                <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eigofy/foefaklgdkdbnpfcfoiplcejnefgemnf" target="Eigofy on the chrome webstore">Eigofy</a>, 
                which helps Japanese people learn English. Please consider checking that out if you are interested.
